# High Prevalence of Stunting, Wasting, and Underweight in Children Under Five in Mopeia District, Rural Mozambique

This code assesses the prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight as well as their association with socioeconomic status in children under 5 years old in Mopeia District, within Zambezia Province, central Mozambique.

Data was collected in 2021 under BOHEMIA’s (Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa) cluster randomized clinical trial. A randomly-selected sub-sample of 2,667 children under 5 years from the BOHEMIA data is included in this analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated to assess the strength of association between risk factors. A wealth index for each household, which was previously developed in prior research, is used to assess the relationship between socioeconomic status and undernutrition.
